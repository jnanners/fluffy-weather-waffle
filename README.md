## Description
This is a weather dashboard app that allows the user to input a location and see the current weather and 5-day forecast for that location. The app uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as the data from the OpenWeather servers, accesses through an API key. I created this application as a project for my bootcamp class, and it helped me further develop my skills with all the technologies I used.

## Resources
To access the OpenWeather API go to https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api and make an account.
